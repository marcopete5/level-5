                    <code>Node</code> is a powerful tool that allows
                    <code>Javascript</code> to be interpreted
                    <em>outside</em> of the browser - most importantly, it
                    allows <code>Javascript</code> to be used as a server-side
                    language.
                </p>
                <p>What does this mean?</p>
                <p>
                    Traditionally we used a backend language (like
                    <code>Python</code>, <code>Ruby</code>, <code>C#</code>,
                    <code>Go</code>, etc.) to retrieve and control the data from
                    the database. It was then passed to the
                    <em>front end</em> where <code>JavaScript</code> (and the
                    browser) would take over displaying the information to the
                    end user. Thus nearly every <em>back end</em> programmer had
                    to know <code>JavaScript</code> <em>and</em> some other
                    language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>Javascript</code> was made to use in the browser, but
                    <code>Node</code> changed that. A programmer could use
                    <code>Javascript</code> on the <em>front end</em> to display
                    the information <strong>AND</strong> use
                    <code>Javascript</code>, with <code>Node</code>, on the
                    <em>back end</em> to get and manipulate data from the data
                    base.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>Node</code> has a vast community of contributors and a
                    large amount of packages available via the
                    <code>Node Package Manager (NPM)</code>.
                    <code>Node</code> is one of the most contributed to programs
                    in the world.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    <code>Node</code> was built on top of the
                    <code>JavaScript V8 Engine</code>, which was developed by
                    Google to run <code>JavaScript</code> code in the Google
                    Chrome browser. The <code>V8 Engine</code> is widely
                    considered the best <code>JavaScript</code> engine available
                    out there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through an initiative in the open source community, the
                    power of the <code>V8 Engine</code> was brought to the
                    command line by the creation of <code>Node.js</code>.
                    <code>Node.js</code> is free and open-source, comes with its
                    own extensive API for interacting with your machine (instead
                    of just a browser window), and thus allows developers to
                    build a server entirely in <code>JavaScript</code>. Before
                    <code>node.js</code>, servers needed to be written in
                    languages that were already built to interact with machine
                    code such as <code>C#</code>, <code>Java</code>,
                    <code>Python</code>, or <code>Ruby</code> (amongst many
                    others). Now a developer can write both server-side and
                    client-side code entirely in <code>JavaScript</code>!
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are certain requirements we need in a system in order
                    to create a web server:
                </p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        Better ways to organize our code into reusable pieces
                    </li>
                    <li>Ways to deal with files</li>
                    <li>Ways to deal with databases</li>
                    <li>Ability to communicate over the internet</li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to accept requests and send responses (in a
                        consistent and standard way)
                    </li>
                    <li>Way to deal with work that takes a long time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The creators of <code>Node.js</code> added APIs that allow
                    it to accomplish all of the above requirements. The full API
                    documentation can be found at
                    <a
                        href="https://nodejs.org/api/"
                        target="_blank"

                        >nodejs.org/api/</a
                    >. Any aspiring <code>Node.js</code> developer should read
                    through the <code>Node.js</code> documentation extensively
                    to become familiar with the tools that are available at your
                    disposal.
