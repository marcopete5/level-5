                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    You are a bounty hunter of the Old Republic. Your parents
                    were killed by a Sith Lord as a child and your goal in life
                    is to kill all the Sith and Jedi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to help you in your quest, and since you are a
                    do-it-yourself kind of bounty hunter, you have learned
                    programming so you can keep track of your bounties and
                    kills!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using <code>Express</code>, create an API on the
                    <code>/bounty</code> route that:
                </p>
                <ol class="custom-list">
                    <li><code>GET</code>s a list of all bounties</li>
                    <li><code>POST</code>s new bounties,</li>
                    <li><code>DELETE</code>s a bounty</li>
                    <li><code>PUT</code>s (updates) a bounty</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Since we haven't started connecting to
                    <code>MongoDB</code> quite yet, you can just save your
                    bounties in a <code>bounties</code> array in your server
                    code. Keep in mind that since it isn't being persisted
                    anywhere, anytime you make a change to your server code and
                    restart the server, you'll lose all your bounties.
                </p>
                <p>A bounty object should have:</p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>First Name</li>
                    <li>Last Name</li>
                    <li>Living (Boolean)</li>
                    <li>Bounty Amount (number)</li>
                    <li>Type (‘Sith’ or ‘Jedi’)</li>
                    <li>
                        ID (a unique identifier. Use the
                        <code>uuid</code> package to generate unique ids. -
                        <code>npm install uuid</code> and check the
                        <a
                            href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid"
                            target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener"
                            >docs</a
                        >
                        to see how to use it. It's as simple as requiring the
                        package and running <code>uuid.v4()</code>)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Since there isn't a front end set up yet, you'll just use
                    <code>Postman</code> to interact with the server and update
                    the data.

                <h3>Objective for PART 3 - Client Setup</h3>
                <p>
                    For this part you will have to
                    <a
                        href="https://coursework.vschool.io/setting-up-a-full-stack-react-application/"

                        >set up a full stack React application</a
                    >. Since you do not have a database yet, ignore the
                    <code>/models</code> folder contained in the example. You
                    instead will have something like
                    <code>bountyData.js</code> which contains your data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will now build a client-side React interface for the
                    server you created!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your app should be a CRUD application - it should be able
                    to:
                </p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>Create (<code>POST</code>) new bounties,</li>
                    <li>
                        Read (<code>GET</code>) existing bounties and show them
                        to the user of your site,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Update (<code>PUT</code>) existing bounties (e.g. if you
                        wanted to up the price for a bounty), and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Destroy (<code>DELETE</code>) bounties from the list of
                        all bounties.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You will need to use everything you've learned about state
                    management, HTTP, and forms!
                </p>
                <p>The design is up to you, so have fun with it!</p>
