                    Follow the instruction below to setup your MongoDB
                    connection
                </p>
                <p><strong>*We suggest using MongoDB Atlas</strong></p>
                <p>Follow the instructions below to set up MongoDB Atlas</p>
                <h3>Set up MongoDB Atlas</h3>
                <p>
                    Atlas is MongoDB's cloud database service. It lets you host
                    your databases for free up to a certain amount, and what's
                    great about it is you don't need to input any credit card
                    details at all to get started.
                </p>
                <h4>Creating a MongoDB Atlas Account</h4>
                <p>
                    Head over to
                    <a
                        href="https://www.mongodb.com/try"
                        target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener"
                        >https://www.mongodb.com/try</a
                    >
                    to create your account. You'll then be taken to a page where
                    you can enter your project details and your preferred
                    language (JavaScript).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next you'll be prompted to choose your cluster (a cluster is
                    MongoDB's term to mean several servers working together to
                    carry your data). Select the free, Shared cluster option.
                    After, you can choose your settings for your starter
                    cluster. Atlas provides 3 cloud platforms, all of which have
                    free tiers. Choose AWS and select the recommended region, N.
                    Virginia (us-east-1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under Cluster Tier, select the free, M0 Sandbox tier. Then
                    choose a name for your cluster or leave it as is, then
                    create your cluster.
                </p>
                <h4>Creating a User</h4>
                <p>
                    It will take a few minutes to create your cluster, so in the
                    meantime let's create a user. On the left-hand side
                    navigation menu, click on Database Access then Add New
                    Database User. Create a username and password, and remember
                    to note the password somewhere, as you'll be needing it
                    later to connect your database in your app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below that set your Database User Privileges to Atlas Admin,
                    and finish creating your user.
                </p>
                <h4>Access</h4>
                <p>
                    Next, you'll need to whitelist your IP address so that you
                    can access your cluster. Go to Network Access on the
                    navigation menu, and Add IP Address. You can either Add Your
                    Current IP Address or Allow Access from Anywhere. Confirm
                    your choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For any projects deployed through Heroku, you'll have to
                    select Allow Access from Anywhere. This is because Heroku
                    uses Dynamic IPs. While this isn't the most secure option,
                    it is fine for now.
                </p>
                <h4>Connecting Your Cluster to Your App</h4>
                <p>
                    Go to Clusters to view your newly-created cluster. Click on
                    Connect, then MongoDB for VS Code (in the list under Access
                    your data through tools). Copy the connection string and
                    replace <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> and
                    <code>&lt;password&gt;</code> with the user details you
                    created earlier. It will look something like this:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-text">
mongodb+srv://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@cluster0.kbgkapq.mongodb.net/
            </code></pre>
                <p>Use the string in the <code>mongoose.connect()</code></p>
            </div>
