                <h3>Common HTTP Status Codes in Backend Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Understanding HTTP status codes is essential for handling
                    responses in web applications. These codes indicate the
                    outcome of an HTTP request made to a web server. Here are
                    some commonly used status codes:
                </p>
                <h4>Informational (1xx):</h4>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>100 Continue</code>:</strong> The server
                        has received the initial part of the request and is
                        willing to continue processing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>101 Switching Protocols</code>:</strong>
                        The server has agreed to switch protocols, such as
                        upgrading to WebSocket.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Successful (2xx):</h4>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>200 OK</code>:</strong> The request was
                        successful, and the server returns the requested data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>201 Created</code>:</strong> The request
                        was fulfilled, and a new resource has been created as a
                        result.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>204 No Content</code>:</strong> The
                        request was successful, but no data is returned in the
                        response body.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Client Errors (4xx):</h4>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>400 Bad Request</code>:</strong> The

                        provide valid credentials.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>403 Forbidden</code>:</strong> The server
                        understands the request but refuses to fulfill it due to
                        lack of permission.
                    </li>

                        cannot specify the exact problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>502 Bad Gateway</code>:</strong> A server
                        acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid
                        response from an upstream server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>503 Service Unavailable</code>:</strong>
                        The server is temporarily unable to handle the request
                        due to overloading or maintenance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>504 Gateway Timeout</code>:</strong> The
                        proxy server did not receive a timely response from the
                        upstream server.

                        user has sent too many requests within a specific time
                        frame, exceeding rate limits.

                        The requested resource can be found under a different
                        URL temporarily.

                        resource has not been modified since the last request,
                        allowing the client to use its cached copy.

                <p>
                    These status codes are fundamental for interpreting and
                    responding to HTTP requests effectively in web development.
