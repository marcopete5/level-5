                <h3>Objectives</h3>
                <p>
                    Choose a thing/noun of any kind, then write an express
                    server with a <code>GET</code> route that sends back an
                    array of that thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your <code>GET</code> endpoint should be able to check for
                    any query parameters that may have been passed into the url
                    of the request and filter the results based on those query
                    parameters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, let's say I chose "fruit" as my noun. A
                    <code>GET</code> request to
                    <code>http://localhost:8000/fruit</code> would return an
                    array with all fruits on my server (use an array to store
                    the fruits, and you may want to hard code a few in there so
                    you have some data to work with when the server restarts
                    itself.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, a <code>GET</code> request to
                    <code>http://localhost:8000/fruit?type=banana</code> should
                    filter out any fruits in the array that don't have a
                    <code>type</code> of <code>banana</code> and return an array
                    to me (in <code>Postman</code>, Angular, or whatever front
                    end I'm using) with only the objects with a
                    <code>type</code> of <code>banana</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the purposes of this exercise, you can write your server
                    code with the assumption that there is only one query
                    parameter option available. So in the above example, I can
                    write my server's <code>GET</code> route to only filter if
                    req.query.type isn't undefined.
                </p>

                    Write another route where an API user can filter by a
                    maximum price AND a minimum price. You can make the maximum

                    A really good method to filter out all of the items you need
                    is the filter method.

                    MORE SPOILERS BELOW!! If you scroll down, you agree that a
                    bit of struggle is good for the learning process. Attempting
                    problems on your own helps you with:

                    <li>

                        Getting feedback from your code for the part that you
                        understand yourself, and then seeing what you might on
                        done wrong when you see how you could have done it

                    <li>
                        Increasing your understanding of the different parts of
                        the problem if all you were able to do on your own was
                        think about what the exercise was asking for, and think
                        through how you might do it
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">
const filteredItems = __________.______(_____ => {
    ______ ____.____ === ___.____.___
})
            </code></pre>
                <p>
                    There's a lot of blanks there, fill them in with AT LEAST
                    educated guesses, and then compare your version
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-jsx">

                    If this is challenging to you, you may want to consider
                    redoing the array iterator methods <code>.map()</code>,
                    <code>.find()</code>, <code>.filter()</code>,
                    <code>.some()</code>, <code>.every()</code>, and any others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These methods have a lot in common. If you're getting better
                    at one, you're getting better at them all.
