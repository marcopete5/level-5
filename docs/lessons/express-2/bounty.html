                <p>
                    You are a bounty hunter of the Old Republic. Your parents
                    were killed by a Sith Lord as a child and your goal in life
                    is to kill all the Sith and Jedi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to help you in your quest, and since you are a
                    do-it-yourself kind of bounty hunter, you have learned
                    programming so you can keep track of your bounties and
                    kills!

                    Using <code>Express</code>, create an API on the
                    <code>/bounty</code> route that:

                <ol class="custom-list">
                    <li><code>GET</code>s a list of all bounties</li>
                    <li><code>POST</code>s new bounties,</li>
                    <li><code>DELETE</code>s a bounty</li>
                    <li><code>PUT</code>s (updates) a bounty</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Since we haven't started connecting to
                    <code>MongoDB</code> quite yet, you can just save your
                    bounties in a <code>bounties</code> array in your server
                    code. Keep in mind that since it isn't being persisted
                    anywhere, anytime you make a change to your server code and
                    restart the server, you'll lose all your bounties.
                </p>
                <p>A bounty object should have:</p>

                    <li>Last Name</li>
                    <li>Living (Boolean)</li>
                    <li>Bounty Amount (number)</li>

                    <li>
                        ID (a unique identifier. Use the
                        <code>uuid</code> package to generate unique ids. -
                        <code>npm install uuid</code> and check the

                        to see how to use it. It's as simple as requiring the
                        package and running <code>uuid.v4()</code>)
                    </li>

                <p>
                    Since there isn't a front end set up yet, you'll just use
                    <code>Postman</code> to interact with the server and update
                    the data.

                <p>
                    Since we don't have a <em>good</em> way to tell the server
                    which item we want to <code>PUT</code> and
                    <code>DELETE</code> yet, we'll start out just by writing the
                    <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> endpoints.

                    <li>
                        Write a <code>GET</code> endpoint that gets all bounties
                        from the array and sends them to the client.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Write a <code>POST</code> endpoint that adds a new
                        bounty object to the array of bounties.

                                Remember, you'll have to play the part of the
                                database and add an <code>id</code> property to
                                the incoming bounty before saving it to the
                                array of bounties. This way you'll be able to
                                easily look it up by its
                                <code>id</code> property in order to update and
                                delete it later.
