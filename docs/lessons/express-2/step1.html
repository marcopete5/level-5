                    As you embark on the journey of developing your own backend
                    API for data access, you'll quickly realize the complexity
                    that can arise. This complexity can be managed effectively
                    by adhering to the principles of
                    <strong><code>REST</code></strong> (Representational State
                    Transfer), a widely-used design approach for creating APIs.
                    This guide will focus on the most important and
                    beginner-friendly aspects of RESTful API design to help you
                    keep your API organized, understandable, and user-friendly.

                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>
                    To illustrate these concepts, let's consider an example of a
                    website that sells outdoor equipment, such as snowboards,
                    skis, bikes, and more. Keep in mind that there is no single
                    "right" way to structure an API, so the solution we present
                    here is not the only one possible.

                <h3>Terminology</h3>
                <p>
                    Before diving into <code>REST</code> API design, let's
                    establish some key terms you'll encounter throughout this
                    lesson:
                </p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Resource</strong>: A single instance of an
                        object, for example, a specific brand/model of a
                        snowboard.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Collection</strong>: A group of similar objects,
                        like all the mountain bikes sold in your store,
                        regardless of brand or model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Base (or Root) URL</strong>: The initial part of
                        the URL for all requests to your API. It typically
                        appears as something like
                        <code>http://api.equipment.com/v1</code> or
                        <code>http://equipment.com/api/v1</code>. The "v1"
                        indicates that this is the first version of your API,
                        allowing you to create updated versions in the future.
                        This distinction helps manage changes and updates to
                        your API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>API Endpoint</strong>: The part of the URL that
                        follows the Base URL, such as <code>/ski</code> or
                        <code>/ski/:skiId</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>:nounId</code></strong
                        >: The colon (:) preceding a word indicates that dynamic
                        data is expected in that part of the endpoint. For
                        example, in <code>/ski/:skiId</code>, the endpoint could
                        be something like <code>/ski/1234</code>, where
                        <code>1234</code> represents the unique ID of a specific
                        ski in your database.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Client</strong>: The entity, whether a person or
                        a machine, that consumes information from your API. In
                        this context, it often refers to a browser application,
                        like an Angular app running in a Chrome browser, but it
                        could also be an iOS or Android app or even another
                        server accessing your API for data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Server</strong>: The machine where your API
                        runs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Request Method</strong>: The type of operation
                        performed on the database, including
                        <code>GET</code> (retrieve data),
                        <code>POST</code> (create new data),
                        <code>PUT</code> (update data), and
                        <code>DELETE</code> (remove data).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Nouns > Verbs</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the primary principles of RESTful API design is to
                    keep API endpoints clear and easy to understand in terms of
                    the resource they provide. In the past, non-RESTful design
                    practices led to endpoints like <code>/get-tents</code>,
                    which returned a list of tents from the database. With
                    <code>REST</code>, the request method already specifies the
                    operation (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>,
                    <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>), so the endpoint
                    itself should only contain the noun representing the
                    resource. Instead of making a <code>GET</code> request to
                    <code>/get-tents</code>, create an endpoint that handles
                    <code>GET</code> requests for <code>/tent</code> or
                    <code>/tents</code>. You can choose to use singular or
                    plural nouns, but consistency is key. In this lesson, we'll
                    stick with singular nouns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using nouns allows you to reuse endpoints and perform
                    different actions based on the request method, leading us to
                    the next section.

            <div class="section">
                <h3>
                    <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>,

                <h4>GET List of Resources</h4>
                <p>
                    In a RESTful design, a <code>GET</code> request to
                    <code>/bike</code> should return an array (list) of bikes
                    from your API. In the context of our outdoor equipment
                    store, this would be a list of bikes to be displayed on a
                    web page, including details like images, brand names, and
                    prices. Some APIs may limit the amount of information
                    returned in a "GET list" endpoint, ensuring that the
                    response doesn't contain unnecessary data.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        <code>GET /tent</code> - returns a list of tents
                        available in our store.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>GET /glove</code> - returns a list of gloves
                        offered in our store.
                    </li>
                    <li>And so on.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The response for <code>GET /tent</code> might look like this
                    in JSON:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-json">
[
  {
    "brand": "Coleman",
    "model": "Sundome",
    "type": "dome tent",
    "shortDescription": "4-person dome tent",
    "itemNumber": 2000024582,
    "capacity": 4,
    ... and more ...
  },
  {
    "brand": "Marmot",
    "model": "Catalyst",
    "type": "backpacking",
    "shortDescription": "2-person Tent with Footprint",
    "itemNumber": 2000024583,
    "capacity": 2,

  },
  {... and more ...}
]
            </code></pre>
                <h4>GET Single Resource</h4>
                <p>
                    A <code>GET</code> request to <code>/bike</code> returns an
                    array of bikes, while a <code>GET</code> request to
                    <code>/bike/:bikeId</code> returns a single resource object
                    for the bike with the unique ID indicated by
                    <code>:bikeId</code>. For example,
                    <code>GET /bike/123</code> would retrieve a single bike
                    object, not an array, as follows:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-json">
{
    "brand": "Cannondale",
    "model": "CAAD12 Disc Dura Ace",
    "price": "$3,999",
    "type": "Road Bike",
    ... and more ...
}
            </code></pre>
                <h4>POST a New Resource</h4>
                <p>
                    When submitting a <code>POST</code> request to create a new
                    item in the server's database, it is usually directed to the
                    <code>/noun</code> endpoint, not <code>/noun/:nounId</code>.
                    Think of it as adding a new "noun" to the existing
                    collection of "nouns."
                </p>
                <h4>PUT (Update) an Existing Resource</h4>
                <p>
                    <code>PUT</code> requests are used to modify an existing
                    resource, so the endpoint must include the ID of the
                    resource to update. For example, to change the price of a
                    helmet with ID <code>42</code>, you would submit:
                </p>
                <ol class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        A <code>PUT</code> request to
                        <code>/helmet/42</code> endpoint.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An object (or partial object) containing the new price,
                        like:
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <pre><code class="language-json">
{
    "price": "$39"
}
            </code></pre>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note about PUT vs. PATCH:</strong> If you're only
                    updating part of the resource and not completely replacing
                    it, a <code>PATCH</code> request is more suitable than
                    <code>PUT</code>. However, for simplicity and to avoid
                    delving into extensive discussions about
                    <code>REST</code> specifications, we'll use
                    <code>PUT</code> requests in this class for learning
                    purposes. If you're interested in the differences, you can
                    explore this post on <code>PUT</code> vs.
                    <code>PATCH</code>.
                </p>
                <h4>DELETE</h4>
                <p>
                    <code>DELETE</code> requests are used to remove a single
                    resource from the database. The endpoint for
                    <code>DELETE</code> is typically <code>/noun/:nounId</code>,
                    indicating which item should be removed. Sending
                    <code>DELETE</code> to just <code>/noun/</code> would imply
                    removing the entire collection of resources, which is
                    generally not an operation you'd want to allow.

                <p>
                    As resources often relate to other resources, your APIs can
                    become more complex than simple
                    <code>/noun[/:nounId]</code> endpoints. Suppose you're
                    creating endpoints for bicycles in your outdoor equipment
                    shop, and you want to access all the components of a
                    specific bike (frame, brakes, wheel size, etc.). In this
                    case, you might create an endpoint like
                    <code>/bike/:bikeId/components</code>. The "components" part
                    of the endpoint suggests it should return an array of all
                    components for the bike specified by the ID earlier in the
                    URL.

                    It's important to note that nesting the components resource
                    in the bike endpoint doesn't necessarily mean that the data
                    is nested in the database. Components could also have their
                    own endpoints like <code>/components</code> and
                    <code>/components/:componentId</code> for interaction with
                    all components, whether they belong to a bike, a snowboard,
                    or any other product.

                    While there's a wealth of information and differing opinions
                    about what makes an API perfectly RESTful, adhering closely
                    to <code>REST</code> principles will help make your API
                    logical, conventional, easy to use, and organized as your
                    code evolves. To delve deeper into <code>REST</code> API
                    design specifics, you can explore the
