                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    You are a bounty hunter of the Old Republic. Your parents
                    were killed by a Sith Lord as a child and your goal in life
                    is to kill all the Sith and Jedi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to help you in your quest, and since you are a
                    do-it-yourself kind of bounty hunter, you have learned
                    programming so you can keep track of your bounties and
                    kills!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using <code>Express</code>, create an API on the
                    <code>/bounty</code> route that:
                </p>
                <ol class="custom-list">
                    <li><code>GET</code>s a list of all bounties</li>
                    <li><code>POST</code>s new bounties,</li>
                    <li><code>DELETE</code>s a bounty</li>
                    <li><code>PUT</code>s (updates) a bounty</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Since we haven't started connecting to
                    <code>MongoDB</code> quite yet, you can just save your
                    bounties in a <code>bounties</code> array in your server
                    code. Keep in mind that since it isn't being persisted
                    anywhere, anytime you make a change to your server code and
                    restart the server, you'll lose all your bounties.
                </p>
                <p>A bounty object should have:</p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>First Name</li>
                    <li>Last Name</li>
                    <li>Living (Boolean)</li>
                    <li>Bounty Amount (number)</li>
                    <li>Type (‘Sith’ or ‘Jedi’)</li>
                    <li>
                        ID (a unique identifier. Use the
                        <code>uuid</code> package to generate unique ids. -
                        <code>npm install uuid</code> and check the
                        <a
                            href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid"

                        >
                        to see how to use it. It's as simple as requiring the
                        package and running <code>uuid.v4()</code>)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Since there isn't a front end set up yet, you'll just use
                    <code>Postman</code> to interact with the server and update
                    the data.

                    Objective for PART 2 - Adding <code>PUT</code>,

                    <code>DELETE</code>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After learning about <code>req.params</code>, now add
                    endpoints that allow you to:
                </p>
                <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                        <code>DELETE</code> a bounty from the bounties array,
                        and
                    </li>
                    <li><code>PUT</code> (update) an existing bounty.</li>
                    <li>
                        <code>GET (ONE)</code>: get just one single bounty
                        instead of all the bounties
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You'll need to pass the <code>uuid</code> you added when
                    <code>POST</code>ing new bounties as a URL Parameter to the
                    endpoint in order to have a reference to the object you want
                    to update, get or delete.
